    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kulfi, often called Indian ice cream, is a frozen dairy dessert made with heavy whipping cream, whole milk and sweetened condensed milk. 
    </p> 
    <p>It’s generously flavored with saffron, cardamom and pistachios.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sweetened condensed milk:</strong>Sweetened condensed milk is essential for making kulfi.
             It lowers the freezing point of kulfi, which creates a smooth and creamy texture.</li>

<li><strong>Nonfat dry milk powder:
</strong>
This ingredient absorbs excess water, which prevents crystallization in kulfi. This leads to more body and structure in the finished kulfi.</li> 
<li>
    <strong>Cardamom:</strong>
Cardamom is a traditional ingredient in kulfi. It adds peppery, piney and floral notes to the frozen treat. 
You can either use pre-ground cardamom or grind the <br> <strong>cardamom pods</strong> yourself.</li>
<li>
    <strong>Saffron:</strong>
 Another traditional kulfi ingredient is saffron. 
 Saffron is sweet, earthy and floral, and it adds a richly golden hue to its recipes. 
 Considering the fact that saffron is <br> one of the most expensive spices in the world, you should feel free to sub in turmeric.</li>
<li><strong>Cashews and pistachios: </strong>
These nuts add a soft crunch and gentle earthy sweetness, offering a pleasant contrast to kulfi’s creamy texture and floral spice.
</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine and cook the mixture</strong>
        </li>
        <p>In a large heavy saucepan, whisk together the condensed milk, whole milk, cream, milk powder, 
            cardamom, sea salt and, if desired, saffron until blended. Cook over low heat, </p>
            <p>tirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly, 
            about 15 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil at any point.</p>
            <li>
                <strong>Strain and cool the mixture</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
                Remove from heat. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a small heatproof bowl. Let cool.
            </p>
            <li>
                <strong> Add the mix-ins</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
                Stir in the cashews, pistachios and almond extract. This is a great time to add any additional flavorings you’d like as well!
            </p>
            <li><strong>
                 Freeze the kulfi
            </strong></li>
            <p>Spoon the mixture evenly into six 4-ounce ramekins. Cover and freeze them for 8 hours or overnight. 
                If desired, garnish each serving with additional nuts.</p>
        </ol>
