    <h3>To assemble the lasagna

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li> 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Put pasta water on to boil:</strong>
        </li>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on
            high heat.</p>
        <p>It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta
            water),so prepare the sauce </p>
        <p> the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>Brown the ground beef:
            </strong>
        </li>
        <p> In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat.
            Add the ground beef and cook until it
        <p>is lightly browned on all sides.

            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
        <li><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</strong></li>
        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo, we are using yellow bell pepper and red
            onions).</p>
        <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and
            cook half a minute more.</p>
        <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5
            minutes.</p>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong></li>
            <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
    
            <p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition. (The amount of sugar needed </p>
<p>will vary, depending on how acidic your tomatoes are.)</p>
<p>Add salt to taste. Remember that you will later be adding parmesan, which is salty.</p>
<p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the</p><p> bottom of the pot occasionally, making sure nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
<p>Remove from heat.
</p>
<li><strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</strong></li>
<p>By now, the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package</p><p>directions. (Note: noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>
<p>Stir the water often to prevent sticking. Make sure that the water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking process, in order to prevent</p><p>noodles from sticking.</p>
<p>
When the noodles are done, drain them in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>
<p>Spread a little olive oil on a large, rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them once so that all sides get coated</p><p> with some of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.</p>
<li><strong>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong></li>
<p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce over the bottom of the dish and spread it evenly. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles</p><p> lengthwise over the sauce (about 3 long noodles; the edges may overlap, depending on your pan). Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
<p>Sprinkle a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese by placing cheese dollops every two inches.</p><p>Sprinkle half of the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.</p>
<p>Apply the second layer of noodles. Top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the rest of the ricotta cheese, and</p><p> the rest of the parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>Finish with a final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>
<li><strong>Bake:</strong></li>
<p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. If you'd like </p><p>more of a crusty top or edges, uncover the lasagna in the last 10 minutes.</p>
<li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong></li>
<p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat lasagna in a conventional oven or</p><p> microwave. While storing, leave the aluminum tent on. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
